OpenSource Orienteering Control Point

More info on the orienteering game (useful to understand the project): 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering

The project consists in a cube box with Arduino (and other electronic stuff, plus battery) inside. This box can be placed in any place as control point.
Using RFID technology, it's possible to register the competitor path and times.
So at the end point, using same technolgy, it's possible to view and compare on a computer all these informations.
The maps used in this project are based on OpenStreetMap.

Project Explanation in italian is available here:
